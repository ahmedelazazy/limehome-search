          <h2>Our concept</h2>
          <p>
            Limehome combines the quality standard of a hotel with the advantages of a private
            apartment. Our design suites can be found in prime locations in more and more European
            cities and offer much more space than a hotel room in a comparable price range. With a
            fully digitalized customer journey we respond to todays travel needs.

          <h2>Our vision</h2>
          <p>
            We are leading the revolution in the hotel industry and have the vision to offer our
            guests an alternative to standardized, impersonal and cold hotel rooms – with suites
            that are designed to fulfill our guest’s needs. We want that everyone feels like home –
            no matter where.
