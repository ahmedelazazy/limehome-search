          <h2>Our concept</h2>
          <p>
            Limehome combines the quality standard of a hotel with the advantages of a private apartment. Our design
            suites can be found in prime locations in more and more European cities and offer much more space than a
            hotel room in a comparable price range. With a fully digitalized customer journey we respond to todays
            travel needs.

          <h2>Our vision</h2>
          <p>
            We are leading the revolution in the hotel industry and have the vision to offer our guests an alternative
            to standardized, impersonal and cold hotel rooms – with suites that are designed to fulfill our guest’s
            needs. We want that everyone feels like home – no matter where.
